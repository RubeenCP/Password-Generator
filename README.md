# Password-Generator

This project implements a password generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interface that helps you create strong, hard-to-guess passwords. Customize the password length and choose which character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) to include to maximize its security.
